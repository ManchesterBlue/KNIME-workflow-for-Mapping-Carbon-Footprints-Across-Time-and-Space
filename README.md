# KNIME Workflow For Mapping Carbon Footprints Across Time And Space
# Abstract
As the world grapples with the unprecedented challenge of climate change, the role of carbon footprints—defined as the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions that are directly and indirectly caused by an activity or accumulated over the life stages of a product—in shaping our environmental future has never been more critical (Wiedmann & Minx, 2008). Each step we take leaves a mark on our planet, shaping the landscape of tomorrow. In this context, understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon footprints is essential for devising effective environmental policies and strategies. This study aims to harness advanced geospatial analytics to meticulously map carbon emissions over time and across diverse geographies. Utilizing the intuitive data integration capabilities of KNIME, this research endeavors to apply rigorous methods to analyze spatio-temporal carbon data. By melding detailed visualizations with sophisticated data processing, the study seeks to reveal underlying patterns in carbon footprint distribution, thereby enriching our understanding of both global and regional environmental impacts. The expected findings promise to deliver critical insights for policymakers, researchers, and environmental stakeholders, all united in their goal to mitigate the harmful effects of carbon emissions. This research will add a nuanced layer to the ongoing discourse on sustainable practices and proactive climate action.

# Introduction
The data I use is currently all from this website: Our World in Data. Our World in Data is a unique web resource that presents empirical research and statistics to make international data on important issues both accessible and understandable. It aims to provide a detailed, data-driven overview of the world’s major challenges and developments across various fields such as health, food provision, the environment, poverty, violence, and education. The "CO2 emissions" section focuses on global carbon dioxide emissions, providing a comprehensive look at their sources, intensity, and impact across different regions and timescales. It includes historical data, present-day statistics, and future projections to illustrate how CO2 emissions have changed over time and what this means for climate change.

The data table I use now is a patchwork of various carbon emissions data available on the site. This is a very large table with all kinds of data about carbon emissions. Including but not limited to the carbon emission data caused by various fuels, carbon emission data of countries and continents, annual per capita carbon emissions, annual carbon emission increase, cumulative carbon emissions and many other variables.

This is my KNIME workflow. I present the body part, eliminating the duplicate nodes such as generating tables or images. To get different variables in this workflow, you just need to adjust them in configure.

I will briefly introduce these nodes, which is convenient for the whole workflow to have a full understanding. The first is rule-based row splitter. In my entire data table, the packets contain countries and continents, and it even includes Asia excluding China and Indi and North America excluding the United States. It is responsible for differentiating them.

I currently plot part of the data about continents and map part of the data about countries. Let's first start with the part about continents. It first delimit a time range using Row Filter. The upper and lower bounds here are 2020 and 1950 respectively. But the upper and lower bounds could be adjusted.

Then the Interactive Range Slider Filter will further select within the range you delimit, which can be slid to easily analyze the carbon emissions over a period of time. One might wonder if this is similar to the previous Row Filter. My answer is that the first part of the selection will lead to other branches in my further exploration. This is just for the purpose of drawing the plots, and for the sake of convenience, I will select the time area again.

<img width="756" alt="image (8)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2ad3c38c-f7a0-436a-a3ad-1b924238cdd3">

The Interactive Value Filter will select the continent from which you want to analyze your data. As shown in the figure, the default continent is Europe.

Finally, we can plot the data for the continent we want to analyze. I have chosen the growth percentage in carbon dioxide. As we can see, there are a lot of options for analysis. We will look at the details of the plot later in the section that presents the results.

Instead of looking at continental changes in carbon emissions, the alternative is to look at global emissions in a particular year. Here's what I talked about in a meeting with Professor Zhang, who wanted me to implement an overall map of the environment. I admit I have taken a lot of detours here. When I first tried to use the geospatial extensions, I either could not generate images or the images I generated were unsatisfactory. Eventually I found that the Choropleth Map Node seemed to fit the bill. Here we first use Row Fliter to select a particular year. Take 2019 here, the eve of covid-19.

This is the Choropleth Map Node that finally draws the map. It can draw a map through a column that we select. Such a map is more clear and intuitive, which can facilitate us to directly judge the overall trend and make a clear comparison.

# Examples
Now I'm going to show you a little bit of that. Since there are many tables and maps that can be drawn as a whole, I will only select a few pictures to mention a little. The first is this plot. we analyze the growth in percentage of carbon emissions in Europe as a whole. This chart vividly illustrates the fluctuations in annual growth rates of carbon emissions across Europe from 1950 to the present. As we observe, there was a significant peak in 1950, suggesting a high point in carbon emissions growth. Following this, the trend generally appears to decline, though the decrease is not markedly steep. It seems that a pivotal event or series of events in the 1950s might have catalyzed a sharp drop in emissions growth, after which the levels largely stabilized, like industrial restructuring, energy efficiency and technological innovations, introduction of nuclear power, and economic shifts especially the Marshall Plan beginning in 1948. The vertical lines and points on the graph represent the variability in annual rates, indicating that despite the long-term trend of decline, there were substantial fluctuations year over year. This could be attributed to varying factors such as shifts in environmental policies, economic activities, or energy consumption patterns. Remarkably, in recent years, the growth rates have even dipped into the negative, signifying that the annual carbon emissions are decreasing compared to previous years. This graph not only showcases the historical changes but also underscores the ongoing efforts and their impact on reducing carbon footprints in Europe.

This graph reflects the results of global per capita carbon emissions in 2019. As you can see, the per capita carbon emissions of the most populous countries, China and India, are not very high. The United States, Saudi Arabia, and Australia are the largest carbon emitters per capita. Despite their smaller populations, these countries have significantly higher emissions due to factors such as higher energy consumption per capita and greater reliance on fossil fuels. This stark contrast underscores the differences in energy use and emissions management strategies across nations. The data highlight the need for tailored policies that reflect the unique economic, industrial, and environmental contexts of each country to effectively address global carbon challenges.

This map illustrates the variation in cumulative carbon emissions per capita across the globe, as of 2019. The intensity of the colors represents the range from the lowest to the highest emissions, highlighting the stark disparities between different regions. Nations like Canada, the United States, and Australia show significantly higher cumulative emissions per capita, as depicted in darker hues, reflecting their historical industrial activities and higher levels of energy consumption from fossil fuels. In contrast, countries in Africa and parts of Asia, marked in lighter colors, exhibit much lower cumulative emissions. This discrepancy underscores not only the varied stages of industrial development but also the differences in energy sources and consumption patterns across countries. Such a visual representation helps identify both the leading contributors to global carbon emissions and those nations that, while rapidly developing, still maintain lower emission levels, offering insights into the global effort to manage and reduce carbon footprints effectively.

This map displays the concentration of computing power across different countries as measured by data centers and computing resources available as of 2019. The scale of the map, ranging from 0 to over 14,684 units, shows a pronounced concentration in China, highlighted in deep purple, indicating a significant dominance in computing infrastructure. This is contrasted starkly by the lighter hues observed in regions like North America, Europe, and parts of Asia, which, although substantial in their computing capacities, do not match the scale found in China. The palest colors across Africa and parts of South America reflect minimal computing resources, underscoring global disparities in technological infrastructure. This geographical distribution is pivotal for understanding the global landscape of technology and innovation, where computing power is a crucial asset for economic development, digital innovation, and competitive advantage in the global market.
