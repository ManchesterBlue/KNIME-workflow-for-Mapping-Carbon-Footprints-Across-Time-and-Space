# KNIME-workflow-for-Mapping-Carbon-Footprints-Across-Time-and-Space
Abstract
    As the world grapples with the unprecedented challenge of climate change, the role of carbon footprints—defined as the total amount of carbon dioxide emissions that are directly and indirectly caused by an activity or accumulated over the life stages of a product—in shaping our environmental future has never been more critical (Wiedmann & Minx, 2008). Each step we take leaves a mark on our planet, shaping the landscape of tomorrow. In this context, understanding the spatial and temporal dynamics of carbon footprints is essential for devising effective environmental policies and strategies. This study aims to harness advanced geospatial analytics to meticulously map carbon emissions over time and across diverse geographies. Utilizing the computational prowess of Python within Google Colab, alongside the intuitive data integration capabilities of KNIME, this research endeavors to apply rigorous methods to analyze spatio-temporal carbon data. By melding detailed visualizations with sophisticated data processing, the study seeks to reveal underlying patterns in carbon footprint distribution, thereby enriching our understanding of both global and regional environmental impacts. The expected findings promise to deliver critical insights for policymakers, researchers, and environmental stakeholders, all united in their goal to mitigate the harmful effects of carbon emissions. This research will add a nuanced layer to the ongoing discourse on sustainable practices and proactive climate action.
